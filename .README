# Does TensorFlow Detect My GPU?

This is a really simple script I made in Python after I was frustrated 
as to whether or not my GPU was being detected. Relying solely on your 
CPU to do TensorFlow programming can lead to unnecessarily long waits.

### Run instructions:

Run as-is in the Python environment where you will be using 
TensorFlow. No special instructions.
