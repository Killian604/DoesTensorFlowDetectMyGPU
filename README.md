# Does TensorFlow Detect My GPU?

This is a really simple script I made in Python after I was frustrated 
in trying to figure out whether or not my GPU was being detected. 
In ML, relying solely on your 
CPU to do TensorFlow programming can lead to unnecessarily long waits, 
so it's important to know whether or not you are using your system
at full potential.

### Run instructions:

Ensure that TensorFlow is installed and run as-is in the Python 
environment where you will be using 
TensorFlow. No special instructions.
